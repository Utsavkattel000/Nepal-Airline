        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Airline Ticket Booking System (ATBS), a user-friendly
          platform designed to make flight booking simple and hassle-free. ATBS
          was created as an academic project with a focus on privacy and ease of
          use. Our goal is to provide an intuitive booking experience without
          compromising your personal information or bombarding you with ads.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy Policy:</h3>
        <p>
          At ATBS, we value your privacy. We don't collect any personal
          information from you, nor do we use cookies or engage in data
          collection. Our platform is completely ad-free, ensuring that your
          browsing experience remains smooth and uninterrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you book a flight with ATBS, we only ask for the essential
          information required for travel purposes. This includes your name,
          contact details, etc. Rest assured, this information is securely
          stored in our database and is never used for anything other than
          booking your flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we take your privacy seriously, there are certain legal things
          that we must comply with. In rare cases such as flight accidents or
          legal proceedings, we may be required to provide passenger data to
          government authorities. However, we will only disclose this
          information when legally obligated to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that our current system does not support cancellations or
          refunds for booked flight tickets. While we may consider adding this
          feature in the future, there are no immediate plans to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using ATBS, you agree to the terms outlined in this privacy policy.
          We are committed to protecting your data and providing you with a
          secure and straightforward booking experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for choosing ATBS for your travel needs. We appreciate your
          trust and look forward to serving you in the future.
